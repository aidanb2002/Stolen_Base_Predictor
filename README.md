# Stolen_Base_Predictor

In this code I created a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a stolen base can be achieved given a variety of variables. Some of the variables include, poptime, sprint speed, total success rate and more. 

Some possible improvements to the model:
  1. This data is from 2022 (pre-rule change) because Retrosheet has not published 2023 data at the time of writing.
  2. Time to plate data for pitchers can be added. (Not publicly available)
